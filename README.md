This repository contains two Jupyter notebook for the Kaggle House Price Prediction competition. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using XGBoost and Deep Learning. Randomized Search was used to optimize the XGBoost model.


# Competition Description
The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables covering almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to predict the final price of each home based on these features. 

# Results
Submitted predictions got a  score of 0.13 for XGBoost model and 0.14 for Deep Learning model.

# Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for educational purposes in data science. It offers a modern and expanded alternative to the classic Boston Housing dataset.
